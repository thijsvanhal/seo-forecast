## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Historical Data

Your dataset should include:
1. **Date column**: Time series data
2. **Target column**: Metric you want to forecast (e.g., organic_traffic, conversions, revenue)
3. **Investment metrics** (regressors): Columns representing your investments

**Example CSV Structure:**
```csv
date,organic_traffic,seo_investment,content_published,backlinks_acquired
2023-01-01,1000,0,0,0
2023-02-01,1050,0,0,0
2023-03-01,1100,5000,10,5
2023-04-01,1300,5000,15,8
2023-05-01,1450,8000,20,12
2023-06-01,1600,8000,25,15
```

**Key Investment Metrics for SEO:**
- `seo_investment`: Monthly SEO budget ($)
- `content_published`: Number of content pieces/blog posts created
- `backlinks_acquired`: Number of quality backlinks obtained
- `technical_fixes`: Number of technical SEO improvements
- `keyword_rankings_top10`: Number of keywords ranking in top 10
- `pages_optimized`: Number of pages optimized

### Step 2: Configure the Model

1. **Upload Your Data**: Load your CSV file in the dashboard
2. **Select Columns**: Choose date and target columns
3. **Add Regressors**: In the "Regressors" section, select your investment metrics
   - These will become the variables you can adjust in scenarios
   - Prophet will learn the historical relationship between investment and results

### Step 3: Enable and Configure Lag Effects

SEO investments don't show immediate results. Enable lag effects to model this:

1. Navigate to **"Lag Effects"** in the sidebar (under "Regressors")
2. Check **"Enable lag effects (recommended for SEO)"**
3. For each regressor, choose:
   - **Quick (suggested)**: Uses standard lags (1, 3, 6 months for monthly data)
   - **Custom**: Define your own lag periods

**Recommended Lag Configurations:**

For **Monthly** data:
- SEO Investment: 1, 3, 6 months
- Content Published: 2, 4, 6 months
- Backlinks: 1, 3, 5 months

For **Weekly** data:
- SEO Investment: 4, 12, 24 weeks
- Content Published: 8, 16, 24 weeks
- Backlinks: 4, 12, 20 weeks

### Step 4: Train the Model

1. Configure model parameters (seasonality, holidays, etc.)
2. Set up evaluation (optional but recommended)
3. Check **"Make forecast on future dates"**
4. Set your forecast horizon (e.g., 12 months)

### Step 5: Create Investment Scenarios

1. In the **"Scenarios"** section (under Forecast), check **"Enable scenario comparison"**
2. Choose number of scenarios (2-5 recommended)
3. For each scenario, configure investment levels:

**Example Scenario Configuration:**

**Scenario 1: Baseline (No Investment)**
- SEO Investment: Constant ‚Üí 0
- Content Published: Constant ‚Üí 0
- Backlinks Acquired: Constant ‚Üí 0

**Scenario 2: Moderate SEO Investment**
- SEO Investment: Constant ‚Üí 5000
- Content Published: Constant ‚Üí 10
- Backlinks Acquired: Linear growth ‚Üí Start: 5, Growth: 5%

**Scenario 3: Aggressive SEO Campaign**
- SEO Investment: Linear growth ‚Üí Start: 10000, Growth: 10%
- Content Published: Constant ‚Üí 25
- Backlinks Acquired: Linear growth ‚Üí Start: 15, Growth: 10%

**Scenario 4: Stepped Approach**
- SEO Investment: Step change ‚Üí Initial: 5000, Final: 15000, Change at period: 6
- Content Published: Step change ‚Üí Initial: 10, Final: 30, Change at period: 6
- Backlinks Acquired: Step change ‚Üí Initial: 5, Final: 15, Change at period: 6

### Step 6: Run the Forecast

1. Click **"Launch forecast"**
2. Wait for the model to train and generate predictions
3. Scroll down to see the **"Investment Scenario Comparison"** section

## Best Practices

### 1. Historical Data Requirements
- **Minimum**: 12-24 periods of historical data
- **Optimal**: 24-36+ periods for reliable patterns
- **Essential**: Historical data should include periods with varying investment levels
  - If you've never invested before, the model can't learn the relationship
  - Include periods with low, medium, and high investment if possible

### 2. Realistic Scenario Modeling
- Base scenarios on realistic budget constraints
- Consider diminishing returns (logarithmic vs. linear growth)
- Account for capacity constraints (e.g., content production limits)
- Use historical performance as a guide

### 3. Lag Period Selection
- **Monthly data**: 3-6 month lags are typical for SEO
- **Content marketing**: Often has longer lags (4-6 months)
- **Technical SEO**: Can show faster results (1-3 months)
- **Link building**: Medium lag (2-4 months)

### 4. Interpreting Results
- **Confidence intervals** show uncertainty - wider intervals mean less certainty
- **Large gaps between scenarios** indicate strong investment impact
- **Small gaps** suggest other factors are more important or you need more historical data
- **Unrealistic growth** might indicate overfitting or insufficient historical variation

### 5. Communicating with Clients
- Start with baseline scenario to show "do nothing" outcome
- Show 2-3 investment levels (moderate, high, aggressive)
- Emphasize ROI metrics and efficiency ratios
- Be transparent about confidence intervals and uncertainties
- Explain lag effects: "Results compound over time"

## Example Use Case: SEO Sales Pitch

### Scenario Setup
You're pitching SEO services to a client with historical data showing organic traffic decline:

**Historical Context:**
- Current organic traffic: 5,000 visitors/month
- Declining 2% per month
- No current SEO investment

**Your Pitch Scenarios:**

1. **Baseline**: Continue current trajectory (no investment)
   - Forecast: 4,100 visitors/month in 12 months (-18%)

2. **Basic SEO Package** ($5,000/month):
   - 10 optimized content pieces/month
   - 5 quality backlinks/month
   - Forecast: 6,500 visitors/month in 12 months (+30%)
   - ROI: 30% traffic increase = 1,500 extra visitors/month

3. **Premium SEO Package** ($12,000/month):
   - 25 optimized content pieces/month
   - 15 quality backlinks/month
   - Technical SEO overhaul
   - Forecast: 9,200 visitors/month in 12 months (+84%)
   - ROI: 84% traffic increase = 4,200 extra visitors/month

### Talking Points
- "Based on similar websites we've worked with, here's what we can project..."
- "The premium package shows faster growth due to compounding effects"
- "Notice how results accelerate after month 3-4 as SEO efforts mature"
- "Even the basic package reverses the decline and puts you back on growth trajectory"

## Advanced Features

### Custom Investment Patterns

You can model complex investment patterns:

**Seasonal Investment:**
```
Jan: $5K, Feb: $5K, Mar: $8K, Apr: $8K, May: $8K, Jun: $5K, Jul: $5K, Aug: $8K, Sep: $8K, Oct: $8K, Nov: $5K, Dec: $5K
```

**Ramping Strategy:**
Use linear growth with appropriate parameters to model gradual investment increase.

**Campaign-Based:**
Use step changes to model before/after campaign impacts.

### Combining Multiple Regressors

Model complex strategies with multiple investment levers:
- Increase content while maintaining backlinks
- Ramp up backlinks while reducing content (focus shift)
- Step up all investments simultaneously (major initiative)

### Sensitivity Analysis

Create scenarios that vary one factor at a time:
- Scenario A: Double content, keep others constant
- Scenario B: Double backlinks, keep others constant
- Scenario C: Double investment, keep others constant

This helps identify which investment areas have the most impact.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scenarios show little difference
**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient historical variation in investment levels
- Regressors not strongly correlated with target
- Need more historical data
- Lag periods not configured correctly

**Solutions:**
- Review historical data for investment variation
- Check regressor correlation with target
- Collect more historical data
- Experiment with different lag configurations

### Issue: Unrealistic forecasts
**Possible causes:**
- Overfitting on limited data
- Extreme scenario values outside historical range
- Missing important regressors (seasonal factors, etc.)

**Solutions:**
- Add more historical data
- Keep scenario values within reasonable bounds
- Include holidays and seasonality in the model
- Use cross-validation to check model validity

### Issue: High uncertainty (wide confidence intervals)
**Possible causes:**
- Noisy historical data
- Insufficient data points
- High natural variability in target metric

**Solutions:**
- This is normal - be transparent about uncertainty
- Collect more data over time
- Consider aggregating to lower frequency (weekly ‚Üí monthly)
- Focus on trend direction rather than exact numbers

## Technical Details

### Lag Implementation
The lag effect feature creates additional columns in your dataset:
- Original: `seo_investment`
- With lags: `seo_investment`, `seo_investment_lag_1`, `seo_investment_lag_3`, `seo_investment_lag_6`

Prophet learns separate coefficients for each lag, allowing it to model delayed effects.

### Scenario Forecasting
For future forecasts with scenarios:
1. User-defined future regressor values are provided
2. Lagged features are calculated using historical data for initial lags
3. Future lags use the scenario's own future values
4. Prophet generates forecasts using the learned relationships

### Model Training
The model learns relationships from historical data:
- Trend component: Baseline growth/decline
- Seasonal components: Yearly, monthly, weekly patterns
- Holiday effects: Impact of specific dates
- Regressor effects: Impact of investment metrics (with lags)

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Causation vs. Correlation**: The model learns correlations, not causation
   - Just because backlinks correlate with traffic doesn't guarantee causation
   - External factors (algorithm updates, competitors) aren't modeled

2. **Historical Patterns**: The model assumes future relationships mirror the past
   - If SEO effectiveness changes, forecasts may be inaccurate
   - Major shifts (algorithm updates) aren't predicted

3. **Data Requirements**: Accurate forecasts require substantial historical data
   - Minimum 12 periods, ideally 24+
   - Must include variation in investment levels

4. **Linear Relationships**: Prophet assumes relatively linear relationships
   - Diminishing returns may not be fully captured
   - Consider log transformations for exponential relationships

5. **External Factors**: The model only knows what you tell it
   - Competitor actions aren't included
   - Market conditions must be stable
   - Add external regressors for known future changes

## Conclusion

The Investment Scenario Simulation feature transforms your forecasting tool from a "what will happen" tool to a "what if we invest" tool. This is invaluable for:

‚úÖ Sales and client presentations
‚úÖ Budget justification and planning  
‚úÖ Strategic decision-making
‚úÖ ROI demonstration
‚úÖ Stakeholder communication

By combining historical learning with lag effects and flexible scenario modeling, you can provide data-driven projections that help stakeholders understand the potential impact of SEO investments.
